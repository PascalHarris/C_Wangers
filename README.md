# C Wangers
C Wangers is my C Library of reusable functions. Lego blocks for software development.  They cover all kinds of useful functionality.  Mostly they come from my head.  Sometimes they're inspired by an idea on Stackoverflow or Geeksforgeeks.  They always makes the process of writing software quicker and easier (for me, anyway).
If you need to use them, please do. If you could see your way to acknowledging 45RPM Software and / or me (Pascal Harris) then I'd be grateful. If you can't then that's fine too.  But… if you spot a bug (and there are a few) or inefficiency (there are even more of those) then please, please, please fix it and submit your changes.  That way we can all benefit.
## Why now?
Well, I've been writing these over many years.  Originally they were in-line in a specific bit of code.  Then later, I pulled them out into their own reusable functions - but still only for a particular project or program.  Then, around 2008, I decided that it was all too inefficient and I came up with these general purpose libraries that I've been using and updating ever since. Recently I started work on a project for another company - and, rather than start from scratch, I used a lot of this code - so the easiest way of synchronising and keeping everything up to date is with Git.  And why shouldn't everyone else benefit.  So here they are.
## But you don't use GTK…
Well not publicly anyway. But some of my software has prototype versions for Linux and Windows - and I use GTK for this cross platform stuff.
## Tedditor
Tedditor is a basic text editor, based upon sedit by incessantmeraki (see Tedditor license), is provided as an example of how to use these libraries. As the libraries get expanded in the future so Tedditor may be expanded too.
